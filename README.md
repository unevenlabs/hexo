It all began with a simple question: When you're strolling through the Metaverse, how can you have an identity that works across different mediums? Easy to say, easy to write, easy to visualize. 

The answer is Hexo ⬡

Hexo uses simple combos of colors and objects (e.g. red dragon), to create universally recognizable identities. 

Instead of owning a single image, you own the entire namespace, and can visualize it however you want, all while keeping your identity constant.
